#When dividing numbers in Ruby, what if we want to include the remainder as well?
#Write a method that takes two integers as arguments, divides the first integer by the second integer 
#and returns the result-including the remainder. If 
#either of the numbers is not an integer, then donâ€™t accept the number and ask again. Do not accept zero (0) as a number.

	if number1.is_a?Integer || number2.is_a?Integer == false 
		puts "We need Integers"
	
	elsif number1 || number2 = 0
		puts "No zeroes excepted"
	else
		puts (number1.to_i / number2.to_i) + " With a remainder of " + (number1.to_i % number2.to_i)
	return result

puts "Enter a number!"
